      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>Idioms Semantic Matching</h1>
    <hr>
    <div>
      In the spirit of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/langnote/eadlaaiecicpfcfpamhfibdpbknfclad">LangNote</a>, we build another feature that helps you learn English phrases and idioms more effectively. 
      Given an (highlighted) English sentence, our model suggests 3-5 expressions that are most related to the meaning of the sentence. Here we present 30 output samples of our demo version. This is obviously imperfect, but we will improve it further. 
      Give it a try first and let us know if you find it useful. 
      <br>
      DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/isVy08">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/isVy08">Facebook</a> and we'll discuss.
